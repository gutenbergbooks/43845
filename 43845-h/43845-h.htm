<h2>THE TALE OF TWO TELEGRAMS.</h2>

<p class="center">ANOTHER DOLLY DIALOGUE.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>By St. Anthony Hope Carter.</i>)</p>

<p>The redeeming feature of the morning batch of letters was a short
note from Lady <span class="smcap">Mickleham</span>. Her ladyship (and <span class="smcap">Archie</span>) had come
back to town, and the note was to say that I might call, in fact that
I <i>was</i> to call, that afternoon. It so happened that I had two engagements,
which seemed to make that impossible, but I spent a shilling
in telegrams, and at 4.30 (the hour <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> had named) was duly
ringing at the Mickleham town mansion.</p>

<p>"I'm delighted you were able to come," was <span class="smcap">Dolly's</span> greeting.</p>

<p>"I wasn't able," I said; "but I've no doubt that what I said in
the two telegrams which brought me here will be put down to your
account."</p>

<p>"No one expects truth in a telegram. The Post-Office people
themselves wouldn't like it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolly</span> was certainly looking at her very best. Her dimples
(everybody has heard of <span class="smcap">Dolly's</span> Dimples&mdash;or is it <span class="smcap">Dolly Dimple</span>;
but after all it doesn't matter) were as delightful as ever. I was
just hesitating as to my next move in the Dialogue, which I badly
wanted, for I had promised my editor one by the middle of next
week. The choice lay between the dimples and a remark that life
was, after all, only one prolonged telegram. Just at that moment I
noticed for the first time that we were not alone.</p>

<p>Now that was distinctly exasperating, and an unwarrantable
breach of an implied contract.</p>

<p>"Two's company," I said, in a tone of voice that was meant to
indicate something of what I felt.</p>

<p>"So's three," said <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, laughing, "if the third doesn't count."</p>

<p>"<i>Quod est demonstrandum.</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this. I observed that you've already published
twenty or so 'Dolly Dialogues.'" (The dimples at this period were
absolutely bewitching, but I controlled myself.) "So it occurred to
me that it was my turn to earn an honest penny. Allow me to
introduce you. Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Carter</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Carter</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>."</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<a href="images/097b.png">

alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration" /></a>
</div>

<p>I murmured that any friend of Lady <span class="smcap">Mickleham's</span> was a friend
of mine, whereat Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span> smiled affably and handed me his card,
from which I gathered that he was a shorthand
writer at some address in Chancery Lane. Then
I understood it all. I had exploited <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>.
<span class="smcap">Dolly</span> was now engaged in the process of exploiting
me.</p>

<p>"I hope," I observed rather icily, "that you
will choose a respectable paper."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But if we are to have a
Dialogue, perhaps we might begin. I have an
engagement at six."</p>

<p>"Telegraph, and put the contents down to my account."</p>

<p>I noticed now that <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> had a pile of papers
on her table, and that she was playing
with a blue pencil.</p>

<p>"Yes, Lady <span class="smcap">Mickleham</span>," I said, in the
provisional way in which judges indicate to
counsel that they are ready to proceed.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been reading some of the Press Notices of the Dialogues,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Carter</span>."</p>

<p>I trembled. I remembered some of the things that had been said
about <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> and myself, which hardly lent themselves, it appeared
to me, to this third party procedure.</p>

<p>"I thought," pursued <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, "we might spend the time in discussing
the critics."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted, if in doing that we shall dismiss the
reporter."</p>

<p>"Have you seen this? It's from a Scotch paper&mdash;Scottish? you
suggest&mdash;well, Scottish. 'The sketches are both lively and elegant,
and their lightness is just what people want in the warm weather.'"</p>

<p>"It's a satisfaction to think that even our little breezes are a
source of cool comfort to our fellow-creatures."</p>

<p>"Here's another criticism. 'It's a book which tempts the
reader&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"It must have been something you said."</p>

<p>"'&mdash;&mdash;a book which tempts the reader to peruse from end to
end when once he picks it up.'"</p>

<p>"'Read at a Sitting: A Study in Colour.'"</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, don't take that down."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Lady <span class="smcap">Mickleham</span>," said I. "<i>Litera scripta manet.</i>"</p>

<p>"You are not the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. <span class="smcap">Carter</span>, and
you must break yourself of the habit."</p>

<p>"The next cutting?"</p>

<p>"The next says, 'For Mr. <span class="smcap">Carter</span>, the hero or reporter&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"It's a calumny. I don't know a single shorthand symbol."</p>

<p>"Let me go on. 'Reporter of these polite conversations, we
confess we have no particular liking.'"</p>

<p>"If you assure me you did not write this yourself, Lady <span class="smcap">Mickleham</span>,
I care not who did."</p>

<p>"That, Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>," said <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, in a most becoming frown,
"must <i>on no account</i> go down."</p>

<p>"When you have finished intimidating the Press, perhaps you
will finish the extract."</p>

<p>"'His cynicism,'" she read, "'is too strained to commend him to
ordinary mortals&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"No one would ever accuse you of being in that category."</p>

<p>"'&mdash;&mdash;but his wit is undeniable, and his impudence delicious.'
Well, Mr. <span class="smcap">Carter</span>?"</p>

<p>"I should like the extract concluded." I knew the next sentence
commenced&mdash;"As for <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, Lady <span class="smcap">Mickleham</span>, she outdoes all the
revolted daughters of feminine fiction."</p>

<p>Then an annoying thing happened. <span class="smcap">Archie's</span> voice was heard,
saying, "<span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, haven't you finished that Dialogue yet? We
ought to dress for dinner. It'll take us an hour to drive there."</p>

<p>So it had been all arranged, and <span class="smcap">Archie</span> knew for what I had been
summoned.</p>

<p>Yet there are compensations. <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> sent the Dialogue to the only
paper which I happen to edit. I regretfully declined it. But the
fact that she sent it may possibly explain why I have found it so
easy to give this account of what happened on that afternoon when
I sent the two telegrams.</p>

<h2>"OH, YOU WICKED STORY!"</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Cry of the Cockney Street Child.</i>)</p>

<p>Speaking of our Neo-Neurotic and "Personal"
Novelists, <span class="smcap">James Payn</span> says: "None
of the authors of these works are storytellers."
No, not in his own honest, wholesome,
stirring sense, certainly. But, like
other naughty&mdash;and nasty-minded&mdash;children,
they "tell stories" in their own way; "great
big stories," too, and "tales out of school"
into the bargain. Having, like the Needy
Knife-grinder, no story (in the true sense) to
tell, they tell&mdash;well, let us say, tara-diddles!
Truth is stranger than even <i>their</i> fiction, but
it is not always so "smart" or so "risky" as
a loose, long-winded, flippant, cynical and
personal literary "lie which is half a truth,"
in three sloppy, slangy, but "smart"&mdash;oh,
yes, decidedly "smart"&mdash;volumes!

<h2>LYRE AND LANCET.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">PART IX.&mdash;THE MAUVAIS QUART D'HEURE.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene</span> XVI.&mdash;<i>The Chinese Drawing Room at Wyvern.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;7.50. Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>is alone, glancing over a written list</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire (entering).</i> Down already, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>? I <i>thought</i> if I
made haste I should get a quiet chat with you before anybody else
came in. What is that paper? Oh, the list of couples for <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>.
May I see? (<i>As</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>surrenders it.</i>) My dear, you're
<i>not</i> going to inflict that mincing little <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span> boy on poor <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>!
That really <i>won't do</i>. At least let her have somebody she's used to.
Why not Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>? He's an old friend, and she's not seen
him for months. I must alter that, if you've no objection. (<i>She does.</i>)
And then you've given my poor Poet
to that <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span> girl! Now, <i>why</i>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I thought she
wouldn't mind putting up with him
just for one evening.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Wouldn't <i>mind</i>! Putting
up with him! And is that how
you speak of a celebrity when you are
so fortunate as to have one to entertain?
<i>Really</i>, <span class="smcap">Albinia</span>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> But, my dear <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>,
you must allow that, whatever his
talents may be, he is not&mdash;well, not
<i>quite</i> one of Us. Now, <i>is</i> he?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>blandly</i>). My dear, I
never heard he had any connection
with the manufacture of chemical
manures, in which your worthy Papa
so greatly distinguished himself&mdash;if
<i>that</i> is what you mean.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> (<i>with some increase of
colour</i>). That is <i>not</i> what I meant,
<span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>&mdash;as you know perfectly well.
And I do say that this Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell's</span>
manner is most objectionable; when he's
not obsequious, he's horribly familiar!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>sharply</i>). I have not
observed it. He strikes me as well
enough&mdash;for that class of person. And
it is intellect, soul, all that kind of
thing that <i>I</i> value. I look <i>below</i> the
surface, and I find a great deal that is
very original and charming in this
young man. And surely, my dear, if
I find myself able to associate with
him, <i>you</i> need not be so fastidious!
I consider him my <i>protégé</i>, and I won't
have him slighted. He is far too good
for <span class="smcap">Vivien Spelwane</span>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> (<i>with just a suspicion of
malice</i>). Perhaps, <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span>, you would
like him to take <i>you</i> in?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> That, of course, is quite
out of the question. I see you have
given me the Bishop&mdash;he's a poor, dry
stick of a man&mdash;never forgets he was
the Headmaster of Swisham&mdash;but he's
always glad to meet <i>me</i>. I freshen
him up so.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> I really don't know whom
I <i>can</i> give Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>. There's
<span class="smcap">Rhoda Cokayne</span>, but she's not poetical,
and she'll get on much better with <span class="smcap">Archie Bearpark</span>. Oh,
I forgot Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brooke-Chatteris</span>&mdash;she's sure to <i>talk</i>, at all events.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>as she corrects the list</i>). A lively, agreeable woman&mdash;she'll
amuse him. <i>Now</i> you can give <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> the list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">[Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>and various members of the house-party appear one
by one;</i> Lord <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>, <i>the</i> Bishop of <span class="smcap">Birchester</span>
<i>and</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>, <i>and</i> Mr. and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Earwaker</span>,
<i>and</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span> <i>are announced at intervals; salutations,
recognitions, and commonplaces are exchanged.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>later&mdash;to the</i> Bishop, <i>genially</i>). Ah, my dear
Dr. <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>, you and I haven't met since we had our great battle
about&mdash;now, was it the necessity of throwing open the Public Schools
to the lower classes&mdash;for whom of course they were originally
<i>intended</i>&mdash;or was it the failure of the Church to reach the Working
Man? I really forget.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>who has a holy horror of the</i> Countess). I&mdash;ah&mdash;fear
I cannot charge my memory so precisely, my dear Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span>.
We&mdash;ah&mdash;differ unfortunately on so many subjects. I trust, however,
we may&mdash;ah&mdash;agree to suspend hostilities on this occasion?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> (<i>with even more bonhomie</i>). Don't be too sure of <i>that</i>,
Bishop. I've several crows to pluck with you, and we are to go in
to dinner together, you know!</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> Indeed? I had no conception that such a pleasure
was in store for me! (<i>To himself.</i>) This must be the penance for
breaking my rule of never dining out on Saturday! Severe&mdash;but
merited!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> I wonder, Bishop, if you have seen this wonderful
volume of poetry that everyone is talking about&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>?</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>conscientiously</i>). I chanced only this morning, by
way of momentary relaxation, to take up a journal containing a
notice of that work, with copious extracts. The impression left on
my mind was&mdash;ah&mdash;unfavourable; a certain talent, no doubt, some
felicity of expression, but a noticeable lack of the&mdash;ah&mdash;reticence,
the discipline, the&mdash;the scholarly touch which a training at one of
our great Public Schools (I forbear to
particularise), and at a University,
can alone impart. I was also pained
to observe a crude discontent with the
existing Social System&mdash;a system
which, if not absolutely perfect, cannot
be upset or even modified without the
gravest danger. But I was still more
distressed to note in several passages a
decided taint of the morbid sensuousness
which renders so much of our
modern literature sickly and unwholesome.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> All prejudice, my dear
Bishop; why, you haven't even <i>read</i>
the book! However, the author is
staying here now, and I feel convinced
that if you only knew him, you'd
alter your opinion. Such an unassuming,
inoffensive creature! There,
he's just come in. I'll call him over
here.... Goodness, why does he shuffle
along in that way!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>meeting</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>). Hope
I've kept nobody waiting for <i>me</i>, Sir
<span class="smcap">Rupert</span>. (<i>Confidentially.</i>) I'd rather
a job to get these things on; but
they're really a wonderful fit, considering!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">[<i>He passes on, leaving his host
speechless.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> That's right, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.
Come here, and let me present
you to the Bishop of <span class="smcap">Birchester</span>. The
Bishop has just been telling me he
considers your <i>Andromeda</i> sickly, or
unhealthy, or something. I'm sure
you'll be able to convince him it's
nothing of the sort.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[<i>She leaves him with the</i> Bishop,
<i>who is visibly annoyed.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself, overawed</i>). Oh,
Lor! Wish I knew the right way to
talk to a Bishop. Can't call <i>him</i> nothing&mdash;so
doosid familiar. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
<i>Andromeda</i> sickly, your&mdash;(<i>tentatively</i>)&mdash;your
Right Reverence? Not a bit of it&mdash;sound as a roach!</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> If I had thought my&mdash;ah&mdash;criticisms
were to be repeated&mdash;I
might say misrepresented, as the
Countess has thought proper to do,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I should not have ventured to make them. At the
same time, you must be conscious yourself, I think, of certain
blemishes which would justify the terms I employed.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I never saw any in <i>Andromeda</i> myself, your&mdash;your Holiness.
You're the first to find a fault in her. I don't say there
mayn't be something dicky about the setting and the turn of the tail,
but that's a trifle.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> I did not refer to the setting of the tale, and the
portions I object to are scarcely trifles. But pardon me if I prefer to
end a discussion that is somewhat unprofitable. (<i>To himself, as he
turns on his heel.</i>) A most arrogant, self-satisfied, and conceited
young man&mdash;a truly lamentable product of this half-educated age!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Well, he may be a dab at dogmas&mdash;he don't
know much about dogs. <i>Drummy</i>'s got a constitution worth a dozen
of <i>his</i>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culv.</i> (<i>approaching him</i>). Oh, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, Lord <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>
wishes to know you. If you will come with me. (<i>To herself,
as she leads him up to</i> Lord L.) I do <i>wish</i> <span class="smcap">Rohesia</span> wouldn't force
me to do this sort of thing!</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang">[<i>She presents him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>

<p><i>Lord Lullington</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I suppose I <i>ought</i> to know all about
his novel, or whatever it is he's done. (<i>Aloud, with courtliness.</i>) Very
pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>; you've&mdash;ah&mdash;delighted
the world by your <i>Andromeda</i>. When are we to look for
your next production? Soon, I hope.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). He's after a pup now! Never met such a
doggy lot in my life! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Er&mdash;well, my lord, I've promised
so many as it is, that I hardly see my way to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord Lull.</i> (<i>paternally</i>). Take my advice, my dear young man,
leave yourself as free as possible. Expect you to give us your best,
you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">[<i>He turns to continue a conversation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <i>Give</i> it! He won't get it under a five-pound
note, I can tell him. (<i>He makes his way to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>.) I say,
what do you think the old Bishop's been up to? Pitching into
<i>Andromeda</i> like the very dooce&mdash;says she's <i>sickly</i>!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He brings his literary disappointments
to <i>me</i>, not <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>! (<i>Aloud, with the sweetest sympathy.</i>) How
dreadfully unjust! Oh, I've dropped my fan&mdash;no, pray don't
trouble; I can pick it up. My arms are so long, you know&mdash;like a
kangaroo's&mdash;no, what <i>is</i> that animal which has such long arms?
You're so clever, you <i>ought</i> to know!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I suppose you mean a gorilla?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> How crushing of you! But you must go away now,
or else you'll find nothing to say to me at dinner&mdash;you take me in,
you know. I hope you feel privileged. I feel&mdash;&mdash;But if I told you,
I might make you too conceited!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Oh, no, you wouldn't.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">[Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>approaches with</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> <span class="smcap">Vivien</span>, my dear, let me introduce Mr. <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span>&mdash;Miss
<span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.) Let me see&mdash;ha&mdash;yes, you take in

<p><i>Mr. Shorthorn</i> (<i>to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>). Good thing getting this rain
at last; a little more of this dry weather and we should have had no
grass to speak of!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> (<i>who has not quite recovered from her disappointment</i>).
And now you <i>will</i> have some grass to speak of? <i>How</i>
fortunate!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>as dinner is announced, to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>). I say, Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, I've just been told I've got to take in a married lady. I
don't know what to talk to her about. I should feel a lot more at
home with you. Couldn't we manage it somehow?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). What a fearful suggestion&mdash;but I
simply <i>daren't</i> snub him! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I'm afraid, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, we
must both put up with the partners we have; most distressing, isn't
it&mdash;<i>but!</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">[<i>She gives a little

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>immediately behind her, to himself</i>). Gad,

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> There's no need to be so apologetic about it. (<i>To

<p><i>Capt. Thick.</i> Well, I rather thought there <i>might</i> be, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so the work was done. <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>, after a year's hard writing,
had completed her self-appointed task. <i>Douglas the Doomed One</i>
had grown by degrees into its present proportions. First the initial
volume was completed; then the second
was finished; and now the third was
ready for the printer's hands. But who
should have it? Ah, there was the
rub! <span class="smcap">Belinda</span> knew no publishers and
had no influence. How could she get
anyone to take the novel up? And yet,
if she was to believe the <i>Author</i>, there
was plenty of room for untried talent.
According to that interesting periodical
publishers were constantly on the lookout
for undiscovered genius. Why
should she not try the firm of Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Binding and Print</span>? She made up her mind. She set her face
hard, and muttered, "Yes, they <i>shall</i> do it! <i>Douglas the Doomed
One</i> shall appear with the assistance of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Binding and
Print</span>!" And when <span class="smcap">Belinda</span> made up her mind to do anything,
not wild omnibus-horses would turn her from her purpose.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Volume II.</span>&mdash;<i>Wide Awake.</i></h3>

<p>Messrs. <span class="smcap">Binding and Print</span> had received their visitor with
courtesy. They did not require to read <i>Douglas the Doomed One</i>.
They had discovered that it was sufficiently long to make the regulation
three volumes. That was all that was necessary. They would
accept it. They would be happy to publish it.</p>

<p>"And about terms?" murmured <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>.</p>

<p>"Half profits," returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Binding</span>, with animation.</p>

<p>"When we have paid for the outlay we shall divide the residue,"
cried Mr. <span class="smcap">Print</span>.</p>

<p>"And do you think I shall soon get a cheque?" asked the
anxious authoress.</p>

<p>"Well, that is a question not easy to answer. You see, we
usually spend any money we make in advertising. It does the work
good in the long run, although at first it rather checks the profits."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belinda</span> was satisfied, and took her departure.</p>

<p>"We must advertise <i>Douglas the Doomed One</i> in the <i>Skatemaker's
Quarterly Magazine</i>," said Mr. <span class="smcap">Binder</span>.</p>

<p>"And in the <i>Crossing Sweeper's Annual</i>," replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Print</span>.
Then the two partners smiled at one another knowingly. They
laughed as they remembered that of both the periodicals they had
mentioned they were the proprietors.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Volume III.</span>&mdash;<i>Fast Asleep.</i></h3>

<p>The poor patient at Slocum-on-Slush moaned. He had been practically
awake for a month, and nothing could send him to sleep.
The Doctor held his wrist, and as he felt the rapid beats of his pulse
became graver and graver.</p>

<p>"And you have no friends, no relatives?"</p>

<p>"No. My only visitor was the man who brought that box of
books from a metropolitan library."</p>

<p>"A box of books!" exclaimed the Doctor. "There may yet be
time to save his life!"</p>

<p>The man of science rose abruptly, and approaching the casket containing
the current literature of the day, roughly forced it open. He
hurriedly inspected its contents. He turned over the volumes impatiently
until he reached a set.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" he murmured. "If I can but get him to read
this he will be saved." Then turning to his patient he continued,
"You should peruse this novel. It is one that I recommend in cases
such as yours."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am past reading," returned the invalid. "However,
I will do my best."</p>

<p>An hour later the Doctor (who had had to make some calls) returned
and found that his patient was sleeping peacefully. The first
volume of <i>Douglas the Doomed One</i> had the desired result.</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent," murmured the medico. "It had the same
effect upon another of my patients. The crisis is over! He will now
recover like the other. Insomnia has been conquered for the second
time by <i>Douglas the Doomed One</i>, and who now shall say that the
three-volume novel of the amateur is not a means of spreading
civilisation? It must be a mine of wealth to somebody."</p>

<p>And Messrs. <span class="smcap">Binding and Print</span>, had they heard the Doctor's remark,
would have agreed with him!</p>

<p>"You really must join the Army," said the stern old Puritan to the Lord
Protector. "The fate of this fair realm of England depends upon the
promptness with which you assume command."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oliver Cromwell</span> paused. He had laid aside his buff doublet, and had
donned a coat of a thinner material. His sword also was gone, and
hanging by his side was a pair of double spy-glasses&mdash;new in those
days&mdash;new in very deed.</p>

<p>"I cannot go," cried the Lord Protector at last, "it would be too great
a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"You said not that," pursued <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>&mdash;for it was he&mdash;"when you
called upon <span class="smcap">Charles</span> to lose his head."</p>

<p>"But in this case, good sooth, I would wish a head to be won, or the
victory to be by a head;" and then the Uncrowned King laughed long and
heartily, as was his wont when some jest tickled him.</p>

<p>"This is no matter for merriment," exclaimed <span class="smcap">Ireton</span> sternly. "<span class="smcap">Oliver</span>,
you are playing the fool. You are sacrificing for pleasure, business,
duty."</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot help it," was the response. "But mind you, <span class="smcap">Ireton</span>, it
shall be the last time."</p>

<p>"What is it that attracts you so strongly? What is the pleasure that
lures you away from the path of duty?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, and then you will pity, perchance forgive me. To-day
my horse runs at Epsom. With luck his chance is a certainty. So
farewell." Then the two old friends grasped hands and parted. One went
to fight on the blood-stained field of battle, and the other to see the

<h2>SITTING ON OUR SENATE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out
what were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of
the Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject. Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop. Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery's</span> Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of
town"&mdash;<i>at present</i>, you see, but obviously on the point of coming
back, in order to grapple with my letter and the question generally. Sir
<span class="smcap">William Harcourt</span>, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his
return your communication will no doubt receive his
attention"&mdash;<i>receive his attention</i>, an ominous phrase for the
Peers, who seem hardly to realise that between them and ruin there is
only the distance from Wiesbaden to Downing Street. Then Mr. <span class="smcap">Morley</span>
"sees no reason to alter his published opinion on the
subject"&mdash;<i>alter</i>, how readily, by the prefixing of a single
letter, that word becomes <i>halter</i>! I was unable to effect personal
service of my letter on the <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>, possibly because I called
at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a card
should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>"
surely indicates that Sir <span class="smcap">John Rigby</span> will <i>back up</i> his leaders in any
approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism! Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
<i>have not as yet sent any answer</i> shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply! In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.</p>

Lords is as follows. The next time that
they want to meet, cut off their gas and
water! Tell the butcher and baker <i>not</i> to
call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.
If <i>this</i> doesn't bring them to reason, nothing

<p>From <span class="smcap">Henry Sotheran &amp; Co.</span> (so a worthy Baronite reports) comes a
second edition of <i>Game Birds and Shooting Sketches</i>, by <span class="smcap">John Guille
Millais</span>. Every sportsman who is something more than a mere bird-killer
ought to buy this beautiful book. Mr. <span class="smcap">Millais'</span> drawings are wonderfully
delicate, and, so far as I can judge, remarkably accurate. He has a fine
touch for plumage, and renders with extraordinary success the bold and
resolute bearing of the British game-bird in the privacy of his own
peculiar haunts. I am glad the public have shown themselves sufficiently
appreciative to warrant Mr. <span class="smcap">Millais</span> in putting forth a second edition of
a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation. By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally. One more by-the-way. Are we in future to
spell Capercailzie with an extra l in place of the z, as Mr. <span class="smcap">Millais</span>
spells it? Surely it is rather wanton thus to annihilate the pride of
the sportsman who knew what was what, and who never pronounced the z. If
you take away the z you take away all merit from him. Perhaps Mr. <span
class="smcap">Millais</span> will consider the matter in his third edition.</p>

Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies. Didn't get much out of them. In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory <span class="smcap">Sark</span> advances.</p>

<p>Says he believes those two astute young men, <span class="smcap">Edward Grey</span> and <span class="smcap">Sydney
Buxton</span>, "control" the Sheffield Knight. They are active and ambitious.
Still only juniors. Moreover, things are managed so well both at Foreign
Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves. The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played. In such circumstances no opening for able
young men. But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad? Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder. Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins. Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands.</p>

<p>This is <span class="smcap">Sark's</span> suggestion of explanation of phenomenon. Fancy much
simpler one might be found. To-night <span class="smcap">Bartlett-Ellis</span> in better luck.
Turns upon <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>; darkly hints that escape of <span class="smcap">Jabez</span> was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars. <span class="smcap">Rigby</span>, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played <span
class="smcap">Bashmead-Artlett's</span> obvious game by getting angry, and
delivering long speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on
swimmingly, was arrested for fully an hour.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supply voted with both hands.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or
sculptor's art, to see majestic figure of <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>
standing between House of Lords and imminent destruction. Irish
members and Radicals opposite have sworn to have blood of the Peers.
<span class="smcap">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span> is taking the waters elsewhere. In his
absence do the best we can. Sat up all last night, the Radicals
trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen entrance; <span class="smcap">Squire</span>
withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning. Began again to-night.
Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six millions
and welfare of innumerable children. Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, <span class="smcap">St. Arnold-le-Grand</span>,
endeavours to reply to <span class="smcap">Henniker-Heaton</span> without betraying consciousness
of bodily existence of such a person. These matters of
great and abiding interest; but only few members present to discuss
them. The rest waiting outside till the lists are cleared and battle
rages once more round citadel of the Lords sullenly sentineled by
detachment from the Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>When engagement reopened <span class="smcap">Squire</span> gone for his holiday trip,
postponed by the all-night sitting, <span class="smcap">John Morley</span> on guard. Breaks
force of assault by protest that the time is inopportune. By-and-by
the Lords shall be handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below
gangway. Not just now, and not in this particular way. <span class="smcap">Chief
Secretary</span> remembers famous case of absentee landlord not to be intimidated
by the shooting of his agent. So Lords, he urges, not to
be properly punished for throwing out Evicted Tenants Bill by
having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and <span class="smcap">Black Rod</span>
turned out to beg his bread.</p>

<p>Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division. Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Nearly all.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> at last got off for his well-earned
holiday. Carries with him consciousness of having done
supremely well amid difficulties of peculiar complication. As <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>
in flush of unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the
Session will in its accomplished work beat the record of any in
modern times. The <span class="smcap">Squire</span> been admirably backed by a rare team
of colleagues; but in House of Commons everything depends on the
Leader. Had the Session been a failure, upon his head would have
fallen obloquy. As it has been a success, his be the praise.</p>

<p>"Well, good bye," said <span class="smcap">John Morley</span>, tears standing in his
tender eyes as he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader. "But
you know it's not all over yet. There's the Appropriation Bill.
What shall we do if <span class="smcap">Weir</span> comes up on Second Reading?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dam <span class="smcap">Weir</span>," said the <span class="smcap">Squire</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Morley</span> inexpressibly shocked. For a moment thought a
usually equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous
work of twenty months, culminating in an all-night sitting. On
reflection he saw that the <span class="smcap">Squire</span> was merely adapting an engineering
phrase, describing a proceeding common enough on river courses.
The only point on which remark open to criticism is that it is
tautological.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Appropriation Bill brought in.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">George Newnes</span> looked in just now; much the same
as ever; the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed
down by ever-multiplying circulation. Troubled with consideration
of proposal made to him to publish
special edition of <i>Strand
Magazine</i> in tongue understanded
of the majority of the
peoples of India. Has conquered
the English-speaking race from
Chatham to Chattanooga, from
Southampton to Sydney. Now
lo! The poor Indian brings his
annas, and begs a boon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile one of the candidates
for vacant Poet Laureateship
has broken out into elegiac
verse. "<span class="smcap">Newnes</span>," he exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Newnes</span>, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;</span>
<span class="i0">Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>That sort of thing would
make some men vain. There
is no couplet to parallel it since
the famous one written by <span class="smcap">Pope</span>
on a place frequented by a
Sovereign whose death is notorious,
a place where</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great <span class="smcap">Anna</span>, whom three realms obey,</span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A
Village Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue
his studies. There are a good many of us here worth a poet's
attention. <span class="smcap">Sark</span> says the thing is easy enough. "Toss 'em off in
no time," says he. "There's the <span class="smcap">Squire</span> now, who has not lately
referred to his Plantagenet parentage. Apostrophising him in Committee
on Evicted Tenants Bill one might have said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Squire</span>, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;</span>
<span class="i0">Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Appropriation Bill read second time. <span class="smcap">Weir</span>
turned up. Sir <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Lawson</span> and others said "Dam."</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.
Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.</p>

<p>"Parleyment!" said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering
at the gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from
the country. "Parleyment's horff." So am I.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;All.</p>
